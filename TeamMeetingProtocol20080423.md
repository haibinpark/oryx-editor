Live-Demo of current version
  * saving does not work
  * reloading a process sometimes does not work
  * OpenID-Login is missing
  * readonly-mode should also load some UI elements like zooming

  * lack of documentation

Nico explained the tasks of Willi and him for the next weeks
  * usability improvements
    * attaching intermediate events to activities
    * resizing of pools and lanes
  * extensions
    * overlays

    * hagen would like to share his ideas on that topic

Nico explained what he wants to do as project manager
  * introducing guidelines on how to use google code's issue list and wiki
  * pushing all developers to document their work
  * hagen pointed out that he would like the commit messages to be the primary information source for developers and
  * to have browser integrated test cases ("selenium")

Hagen introduced a project for two bachelor students that will evaluate different technologies with the aim to make Oryx browser independant and faster. The output is a recommendation on how to change Oryx to fulfill this requirements. To do this he suggested Willi and Nico to write down the major problems they had with the current technologies used.

Prof. Weske pointed out his timeline:
  * At the end of the week the last integration bugs should be fixed and it should be published to the BPT staff.
  * After two weeks of testing the user numbers should slowly increase by using it in a bachelors' course and offering it to scientists of other universities.
  * Björn should also test it by modelling all processes of the POIS course.
  * Then marketing should start by publishing press releases and using blogging comunity.

Hagen had a feature request:
  * get the RDF representation of a process via URI
